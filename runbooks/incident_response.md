# Incident Response (Platform)
1. Declare severity & page on-call (OpsGenie/PagerDuty).
2. Stabilize: scale out, throttle, feature-flag as needed.
3. Form IM channel, assign roles (IC, Scribe, Comms).
4. Gather data: logs, metrics, traces, recent changes.
5. Mitigate and verify recovery SLOs.
6. Record timeline for post-mortem.
